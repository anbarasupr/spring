MANY to MANY:
A course can have many students
A student can have many courses.


-> We need to keep track of which student is in which course and vice versa. In order to do that, we can make use of join table which is a special table that will maintain the relationships between student and course.

Join Table:
A table that provides a mapping between two tables. It has foreign keys for each table to define the mapping relationship.
